Prints out number \"x\", raised to the power \"y\".\n  4. Prints out the log (base 2) of \"x\".\n```\n\nIn other words, running the program in ps0.py should ask the user for the input, etc. In later problem sets for the class, we will have some test cases that are going to help you see whether your code is correct, so the deliverable is the code, but there are ways to see if your code works.</md>",
