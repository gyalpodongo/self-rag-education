I just submitted a request to be added to 6.100L, but would really appreciate if I could be added to the course website as soon as possible! Also, logistically I am aware that I, unfortunately, missed the first two finger exercises, as well as the first microquiz. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to makeup this work, considering I was able to complete the first microquiz as well as all finger exercises up to this date in the 6.100A/B.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you for your time!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Ava Muffoletto</p>",
