If it is another subtree I believe we need to call it recursively: Node(x) &#43; (find_tree_height(right node)&#43;find_tree_height(left node) (please correct me if this logic is wrong). However, I am unsure how to get reference the Nodes themselves (aka the Node(x) part), and would appreciate some guidance. Thank you in advance!\u00a0</p>",
