I do not think this is possible, as I got more of the multiple-choice wrong.\n\nMy kerb is pabloa.\n\nI believe I should have gotten a 100% on both of the parts I had to code myself (4 of 4 for both parts). I received 1.5/2 on the multiple-choice, but I believe a 1/2 would be correct (since I got  number one right). I also believe that one can do memoization using a direct access array (or a less efficient linked list) so I believe I deserve credit for the second of the multiple-choice questions.\n\nAgain, I would appreciate it if someone can take a look to make sure I got credit where I deserved it and didn&#39;t where I didn&#39;t. \n\nBest,\n\nPablo",
