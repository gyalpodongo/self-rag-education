Note that the tfidf values need to be sorted first by TFIDF VALUE. In the case of ties (i.e. identical tfidf values), we sort by alphabetical order.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your tfidf values are correct. But the array you return looks something like this:\u00a0</p>\n<pre>\n[(&#39;a&#39;, 0.0007341667652125487), (&#39;acting&#39;, 0.0007341667652125487), (&#39;almost&#39;, 0.0007341667652125487), (&#39;and&#39;, 0.0), ... ]</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the correct array, the entry for &#39;and&#39; should come before &#39;a&#39;, &#39;acting&#39;, and &#39;almost&#39;, because it has a lower tfidf score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let me know if you have further questions.</p>",
