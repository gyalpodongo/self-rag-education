Would it be possible for me to do that this week for even partial credit? I can get a note from s3 if needed, I have been working closely with one of the dean&#39;s and with VPR, who can also vouch for my missing assignment. I am very sorry for the late email, I just realized that the due date was not this Thursday.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was also wondering if you had any recommendations for extra study materials, especially regarding classes and dictionaries, as I have somewhat fallen behind in class. I really enjoy the material and the PSETs, so I want to make sure that I am putting my best foot forward. I have also unfortunately missed a few finger exercises, as this semester has been extremely personally challenging, and I apologize for that as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My email is herose@mit.edu if it is better/easier to reply there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you for all of your help,</p>\n<p>Hannah E. Rose</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(I was unsure of who to send this question to, I apologize)</p>",
