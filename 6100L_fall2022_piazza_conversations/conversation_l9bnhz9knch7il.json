I&#39;ve only taken 6.100A in my freshman fall, so I haven&#39;t learned the 6.100L course content, which is why I&#39;d like to look it over to see what students are working on. Since I&#39;m not in the class I don&#39;t have access, so I wanted to ask if there was any way I could get access to the course material?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you! :)</p>\n<p>Frankie</p>",
