However, when I go to check the expected output, I&#39;m not sure I understand why it says that should be the expected output at all. From what I understand, we are testing whether the strings have any overlapping characters and returning True if so, False if not. If this is the case, should&#39;t calling the function with s1 = &#39;abcd&#39; and s2 = &#39;cabaa&#39; return True, since both strings have an &#39;a&#39;, a &#39;c&#39;, and a &#39;b&#39;? I&#39;m not sure what exactly it is I&#39;m missing (I&#39;ve also attached a picture). Thank you in advance!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkqcjswag73ino%2F45513f931f3cd7e58411b9560319d64435695406bc891cc1b1677136e5e7ead4%2Fimage.png\" alt=\"image.png\" /></p>",
