        "content": "<p>Hello, I hope you are well. I made this question private since it contains my working code for the finger exercises released today. I got the code to work by testing it in the actual finger exercise portal (I got 100% on the finger exercise), but it wouldn&#39;t run in Spyder on my computer. I tried to put it into Python Tutor and it ran infinitely as shown in the screenshot below. It says that a dictionary called _annotations_ was created on step one, but I didn&#39;t create a dictionary and this is a new file. Is there a way to fix this? I haven&#39;t touched any settings or buttons (I honestly wouldn&#39;t even know where to find them) so I am completely lost. (The first screenshot is after pressing &#34;run&#34; in the terminal, the second is the response that Python Tutor gives (I used my code from another exercise because the one from this finger exercise wouldn&#39;t all fit in the screenshot, but it is the same result for the other code where nothing is printed and it is instead stored in a dictionary)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw9s6wlp3bo77h%2F7b8f0cda71329376ef63ae80ea9d9d6e40c93a3f53e4e34bc30daeb9b07e983d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_4.30.27_PM.png\" width=\"777\" height=\"486\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw9s6wlp3bo77h%2Fb35cdfc1e3ee096cb8da22a25f7e889057c69a923bd9ad52f206860bbca0b821%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_4.13.16_PM.png\" width=\"749\" height=\"285\" alt=\"\" />)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

I tried running the same code in several files, in the python tutor, and in my general terminal and none of them worked. Sorry for the issues, I just want to make sure my IDE is working before the microquiz!</p>",
