For the last pset, I mistakenly missed the halfway hand-in, so I was wondering how that would impact the overal score of that pset. Furthermore, I saw that I recieved a 96% for pset 3, but received full credit for the check off and the halfway hand in, so I&#39;m not sure how to account for what the overall pset score would be. Is the percentage on the site an accurate way to check my overall standing pset-wise, because it seems quite low (although this could be because I have yet to submit pset 5).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Any guidance would be appreciated. Thank you!</p>",

As far as I&#39;m aware, the only pset which received a score in the B range was pset 4; is that incorrect? Since my other psets were 100 percents or very close, I am a bit confused. Thanks in advance!</p>",
