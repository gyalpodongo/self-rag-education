From what I understand you might have meant that you also wanted me to assign the value of r to be zero. Which would have been very simple for me as I could have simply added a line above this with the code\u00a0</p>\n<p>r=0.0 followed by the print statement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do not believe I should have lost 10 points for this as I do return that the r=0 in the print statement. My logic for not changing the value or r was that you normally refer to changing the variable r in this way &#34;<strong>\u00a0<code>r</code>\u00a0should be assigned the value</strong>\u00a0<code>None&#34;</code></p>\n<p>Could you please let me know if I can still change the code and simply add a line assigning r to 0.0 to get the full points?</p>\n<p>I need to get a specific grade on this course to graduate and I do not want to lose 10 points on this detail that I honestly misinterpreted</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nicolas Agrotis</p>\n<p></p>",
