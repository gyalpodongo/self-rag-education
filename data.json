'step' is an optional argument that determines the increment between each index for slicing.\n\nIf you don't provide 'start' and 'stop', the substring will start from the beginning and go until the end of the string. If you don't provide 'step', the default value is 1, which means it will take each character from 'start' to 'stop'.\n\nFor example, if you have a string s = \"Hello, World!\" and you want to get the substring \"Hello\", you can slice the string like this:\n\ns[0:5]\n\nThis will start at index 0 (the first character) and stop at index 5 (the sixth character), but not include the character at index 5.

If omitted, it defaults to 1, meaning every character is included.\n\nFor example, if you have a string `s = \"abcdefgh\"`, you can slice it as follows:\n\n- `s[3:6]` evaluates to \"def\". It starts at index 3 and goes up to, but not including, index 6.\n- `s[3:6:2]` evaluates to \"df\". It starts at index 3, goes up to index 6, but skips every other character.\n- `s[:]` evaluates to \"abcdefgh\". It includes the entire string.\n- `s[::-1]` evaluates to \"hgfedcba\".

This is where Python recognizes that there is a function in the program that does something specific.\n\n2. Once Python sees the function call, it starts to execute the function. It looks at the input parameters to the function call. These are actual, tangible values that are passed into the function.\n\n3. The formal parameters in the function definition, which are abstract, are replaced with the actual parameters from the function call. For example, if the function definition has a parameter 'i', and the function is called with '3', 'i' is replaced with '3'.\n\n4. Python then executes the expressions in the body of the function using these actual parameter values.\n\n5. If there is a return statement in the function, Python will replace the function call with the return value. This value is then given back to whoever called the function.\n\n6. If the function call is inside a print statement, Python will print the return value.\n\n7. Once the function call is completed, Python exits the function and continues with the rest of the program.\n\nIt's important to note that the function's code only runs when the function is called, also known as invoking the function.

Mapping of parameters: Python then maps the formal parameters in the function definition to the actual parameters in the function call. For example, if the function definition is `def is_even(i):` and the function call is `is_even(3)`, Python maps the formal parameter `i` to the actual parameter `3`.\n\n4. Execution of the function body: Python then executes the body of the function using the mapped parameters. In the example above, it would execute the code `return i%2 == 0` with `i` replaced by `3`.\n\n5. Return of a value: Once the function has finished executing, it returns a value. This value replaces the function call in the original program. For example, `is_even(3)` would be replaced by `False`.\n\n6. Termination of the function environment: After the function has returned a value, its environment is terminated. Any variables that were created within the function's environment disappear.\n\n7.
