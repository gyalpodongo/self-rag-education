Both result in the same apparent output formatting.<br /><br />The reason is because <kbd>num</kbd> is an int, but <kbd>fraction</kbd> is a float, and hence <kbd>num*fraction</kbd> is also a float. If we had left out the <kbd>.0f</kbd> for <kbd>num*fraction</kbd>, it would have printed as <kbd>10,000,000.0</kbd>, instead of just <kbd>10,000,000</kbd>.<br /><br />If this is confusing, try printing ints and floats in the Python shell with different format specifiers.</p>",
