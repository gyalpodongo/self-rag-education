Currently, my score is 0% for the PSET. I had the PSET checked off and no glaring issues seemed to exist. Even if there is an error in my code, I think it would be an oversight to get a 0% on the assignment. Here is my document, if I could have the code manually graded that would great.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks, Tim</p>\n<p><a href=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl8hl4mf744i34u%2F688c0e8cab1a340613714c11deec9fb2df65705240437d107faff4e0686c6e87%2Fps4.py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ps4.py</a></p>",
