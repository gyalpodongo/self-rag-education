As there were no office hours over the long weekend, we were not able to complete any check offs. Additionally, the load_data() section on the Pset incorporates topics of which we have not yet learned, but over the weekend we were not able to attend office hours to clarify them and many, such as myself, were unable to get past this section. Moreover, the immediate deadlines and scarce time is forcing a large number of people to to go to office hours all at once, causing the wait times to be well over an hour and a half, and keeping many of us from completing other work. I understand that there were some scheduling constraints. and I appreciate all of the hard work you have put into planning the class, but I feel that it is unfair to us if we are forced to wait in long queues, and end up having to go to other classes without ever completing a checkoff as the wait is so long. Additionally, much of the time there are office hours, other classes are occurring, further limiting the available time to complete the upcoming assignments. Could the due dates be postponed at all to ameliorate these issues? Could office hours begin earlier in the day? If not, what else can be done to address this issue?",
