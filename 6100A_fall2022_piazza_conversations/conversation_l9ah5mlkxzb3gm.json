        "content": "As I reached my credit limit, I was unable to sign up for 6.100B next quarter. However, I am still very interested in learning the material. Is there any way for me to show up to lectures, do Psets, and still have access to the optional practice on MITx without formally taking the class? Does 6.100B use the same textbook, or is there a different one I would have to order? Additionally, is there a test I would take that would allow me to test out of 6.100B afterwards? I am very grateful for everything I have learned and would very much appreciate to continue my programming journey.",
