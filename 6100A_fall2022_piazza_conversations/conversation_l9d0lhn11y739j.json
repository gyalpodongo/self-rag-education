I looked at the test cases and was wondering if someone could explain to me what was wrong with my code and what test cases were used because I am still unclear on what I did incorrectly.\u00a0<div><br /></div><div>For what I understand, I didn&#39;t finish my load data code because I only considered the &#34;close&#34; column and not the other few. This was because I was more focused on the doc string, which specifiied closing prices, than the problem set instructions online, which mentionend all of the columns. I was wondering, however, if this meant that I also lost points for the plotting portions of the problem set because of the incorrect loaded in data from my previous function.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>I was wondering if I would be able to request a regrade for this situation. I just spoke to a TA about this situation who recommended that I post on Piazza.\u00a0</div>",
