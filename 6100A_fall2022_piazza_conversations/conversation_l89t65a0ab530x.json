Is this something I should try to change, or would this be an acceptable step number? The other test cases were accepted.<br />Also, in the same problem, (part c), I turned the \u2018amount saved\u2019 into a function. Should this be listed under the constants heading in the document or where I completed the steps to reach the r value? (Currently I have it as a constant, since the function itself is referred to.)</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>-Vera</p>",
