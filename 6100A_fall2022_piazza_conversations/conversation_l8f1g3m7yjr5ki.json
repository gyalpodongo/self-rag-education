And after running the tester file, I cannot run my hangman file properly. It&#39;s showed as below. Would you be able to explain what&#39;s going on here? <img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7rw7gfn39b5wm%2F04c8c169768fa7fd6adce8e0ca943013427a3c826b16f206ecdae01ca5bc0ee7%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-23_at_6.09.38_PM.png\" width=\"1090\" height=\"630\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
