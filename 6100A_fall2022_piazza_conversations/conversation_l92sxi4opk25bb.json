Since Python classes just let you access attributes within a class by saying\u00a0<strong>date1.month</strong>, that means that any function or any program that has access to the\u00a0<strong>date1</strong> object can now change the value of its month attribute, and other programs may see that change.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&#39;s a good practice to control how exactly we change those attributes, so we do so by using a\u00a0<strong>get_month()</strong> function, since its sole purpose is to return the month field, rather than allowing you to change it. Date objects don&#39;t have a\u00a0<strong>set_month()</strong> function because we didn&#39;t intend Date objects to be able to change value.</p>",
