It is probably because I didn\u2019t write under comments. I made a stupid move of resubmitting yesterday to just check if that was the problem as ik late submissions aren\u2019t considered and it still didn\u2019t get hundred because I was checking something for myself. Will the submission I made last week be visible to graders so they can manually grade my pset? Can I communicate this in checkoffs? Thanks \u00a0</p>",
