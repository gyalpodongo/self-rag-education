Does that mean we need to build the calculate_similarity_score function with those functions? I built the function without using them. The same thing is suggested in part 6 and I&#39;m not sure how to utilize the pre-existing functions.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

I think it's trying to say that the output from say get_frequencies (a freq dictionary) should be a valid input to calculate\\_similarity\\_score. \n\nin terms of Part 6 about TF-IDF, that involves some frequencies calculations, so using a function you wrote earlier could be helpful.</md>",
