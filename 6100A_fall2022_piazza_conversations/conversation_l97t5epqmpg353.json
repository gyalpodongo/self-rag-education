However, the operand seems not to be working in the autograder, which might be a reason for the lower grade. Could you check my code in different ways?<br />Thank you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fk05dxo3mixn2i3%2F218b4aba0adae1c6c9aa1b7a8e28a345ff8ee0bfe53954631a0a51a355d0bed1%2Fimage.png\" alt=\"image.png\" /></p>",
