My scoring was as follows:</p>\n<p>1: 2/4</p>\n<p>2: 1.2/4</p>\n<p>3: 2/2</p>\n<p>For Q1, the only issue was that I added the key instead of the value of d on my second to last line, causing only 1 test case to fail. Changing this one part(to ans.append(Lk[i])), I would have gotten full credit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Q2, I simply forgot to increment by 1 for i in my innermost loop and had an index out of bound which I could fix by adding i &lt; len(keys) and instead of d[keys[i]] &#43;= freq, d[keys[i-1]] &#43;= freq</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My logic was correct for both questions, but I had very small errors which lead to failing test cases. Could I have a regrade for those two questions please?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
