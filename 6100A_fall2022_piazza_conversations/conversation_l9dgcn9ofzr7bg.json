Because of the four day weekend last week, I couldn&#39;t go into office hours on Monday or Tuesday, and was told at the next office hours that it was too late to make up the pset 2 checkoff. I&#39;m not on PNR and if possible, would be very grateful for the opportunity to explain my pset 2 code for a checkoff. I have two late days left I haven&#39;t used yet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
