It took me a while to get my head around how the classes work. Because of my carelessness in reading the grading policy, I thought that the checkoffs were optional and didn&#39;t do the checkoffs for Pset1 and 2.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I attended every lecture, finished all microquizzes, and submitted all Psets before the due date, so I haven&#39;t used any late days yet. I am planning on applying for Ph.D. so I really need a good grade. I have finished the checkoffs for Pset3 and 4 and I plead with you that I could make up at least the Pset2 checkoff (I saw question129 and the instructor said &#39;you can also use a late day&#39;. <a href=\"/class/l5s90ip6zjd5tz/post/129\">https://piazza.com/class/l5s90ip6zjd5tz/post/129 ) \u00a0</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am so sorry for causing extra trouble and it&#39;s my bad not reading through the course info carefully. I would really appreciate it if I am given a chance to make up things. I understand this week people are busy submitting Pset4 and the TAs will be busy with Pset3&amp;4 checkoffs, so whatever time works for the TAs I am good.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you so much and looking forward to your response!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Yixin Tang</p>",
