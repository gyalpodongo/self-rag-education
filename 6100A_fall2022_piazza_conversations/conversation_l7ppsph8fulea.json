It&#39;s probably fine to not install it, since it functions mostly as a &#34;launcher&#34; for Spyder and other applications. But if you want it, it should be as simple as running the terminal command to install (see the warning banner and the troubleshooting link).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/</p>",
