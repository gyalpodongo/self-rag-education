We ask you not to use this not only because it&#39;s bad practice, but also because this behavior can be modified in Python, where classes can define what it means to be\u00a0<em>equal</em> all internally. The point of this problem is not for you to mess around with that behavior right now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The point of\u00a0<em>is_equal_dates()</em> is to check for\u00a0<strong>functional equality</strong>, or whether these represent the same data. So think about what defines a date (what attributes define this instance?) and whether or not both Date objects represent the same calendar date, and how we can check that within this function.</p>",
