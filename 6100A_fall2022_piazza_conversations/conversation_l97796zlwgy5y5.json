At some point in your code, where you\u2019re supposed to be passing in a date object, you\u2019re passing in a list (most probable location for this is frame_data in my opinion)<div><br /></div><div>PS you should ALWAYS be using getter methods to access attributes. Typing in code like \u2018date1.year\u2019 is generally considered bad coding practice and will cause you to loose points on the checkoff</div>",
