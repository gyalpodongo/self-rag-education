I was initially confused because my code produced the same answers the auto-grader expected so I went to office hours to try and understand what happened. I think the problem lies in the fact that I named the variable supposed to be named &#34;r&#34; as &#34;guess&#34; and &#34;steps&#34; as &#34;attempts.&#34; When it checked for the correct &#34;r&#34; and &#34;steps&#34;, it did not find it because my variables were under a different name. I completely didn&#39;t realize the variable names mattered, and had just renamed them to make it easier to track and understand when reading through my code. I will definitely make sure to name variables correctly in the future, but for now I was wondering if you would maybe consider looking back at my code and giving some or maybe all of the points back (provided it is correct, which I believe it is). Again, I will make sure to do it correctly in the future so I apologize for any trouble. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Landon Dolvin</p>",
