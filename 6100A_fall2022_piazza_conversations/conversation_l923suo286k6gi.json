Specifically, the code fails at a statement where I merge to dictionaries with a \u201c|\u201d\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>I learned to use this operand online and it says that it only works on Python versions 3.9 and higher. Is it possible that the test cases failed because the auto grader version wasn\u2019t high enough or is there a problem when merging with \u201c|\u201d?</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks</div>",
