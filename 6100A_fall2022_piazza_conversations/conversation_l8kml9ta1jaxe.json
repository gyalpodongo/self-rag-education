I had to make some changes based on the test case results but eventually passed all the test cases.<br /><br />The biggest issue is that the instructions tell us to write get_tfidf so it returns a sorted tuple. The &#34;big test case&#34; (test_tfidf_big) sets the expected result to a constant - tfidf_list. That list is not sorted alphabetically.<br /><br />Running with test case as written:\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkvoqxmcvwg30a%2F24792fface96376450b582e927dd424fac349d394c36041e67cbae64f36ec9bd%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_16.01.11.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_16.01.11.pngNaN\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Modified test case:\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkvoqxmcvwg30a%2F44f7b067bb545e024841f6ed78bc736970ee97a629bc72fd753699492f7ad0a8%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_16.01.33.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_16.01.33.pngNaN\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know we&#39;re not supposed to modify the test case but I&#39;m confused, since the instructions were pretty clear that get_tfidf should return an alphabetically sorted tuple.
