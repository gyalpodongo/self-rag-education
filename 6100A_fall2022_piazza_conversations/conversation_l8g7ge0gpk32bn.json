You lose no guesses.&#34;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regardless, for my second question I meant more like in a scenario where they have, say, 3 unique letters remaining. If they have only three guesses left, they ask for help, and help is granted because they have &#34;at least three guesses remaining,&#34; but now they have zero guesses. Do they just lose? Or should this throw the same warning as if they only had 2 guesses remaining saying &#34;Oops! Not enough guesses left:&#34;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I feel like this is getting really complicated because then we have to add logic that checks if they only have one unique letter left in the secret word, and only allow them to use help in that instance. Otherwise, using help with only three guesses left would make them lose the game.</p>",

So, if you have just one more letter left to guess, and you use help, you\u2019ll win. Depending on how you implemented it, this may or may not require you to add further logic.
