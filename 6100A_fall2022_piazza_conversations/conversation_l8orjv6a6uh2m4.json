I feel like I&#39;m doing everything I can to prepare- I make sure I understand all the notes from lecture/recitation and the finger exercises, and do all of the practice questions on mitx. I also find the psets to not be terribly hard, I&#39;ve been scoring well on my checkoffs, and I go to office hours when I don&#39;t understand something. Finally, I make sure to review what I did wrong/understand the correct solutions on past quizzes. Do you have any tips of how to score better? I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong.",
