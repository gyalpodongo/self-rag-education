However, I keep failing test_data_frame_maker_large because of this error: &#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;year&#39;. I have not been successful in debugging this issue by myself and during office hours; however, I know why the error is occurring: the header of my dataframe is set to None when I use the .clear_data() method. Thank you for any advice</p>",

Originally in frame_data(), I was finding the start and end indices to figure out which data to store, but It didnt work until I got rid of this and used the helper functions (is_before, is_after, is_equal) to decide at each position whether to store it or not. I honestly don&#39;t know why my original method gives any different results, but this got rid of the error for me. It was also wild that I passed so many test cases (including test_data_frame_maker_small) without any indication of a problem.</p>",
