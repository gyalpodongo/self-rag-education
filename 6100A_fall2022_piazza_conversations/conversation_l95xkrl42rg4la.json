Why do we still need the &#34;field accessors&#34; namely the get_year/get_month/get_day functions to access these attributes? Wouldn&#39;t date_x.year return the same attribute?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

Otherwise defining a\u00a0<strong>.get_&lt;parameter&gt;()</strong> function allows other functions / programs to access a parameter without the ability to change it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This way we kind of implicitly define which parameters you&#39;re allowed to edit after instantiating a class. For example in the Date class, we have\u00a0<strong>.get_year()</strong> but not\u00a0<strong>.set_year()\u00a0</strong>defined because it&#39;s our intention to use Date objects as functionally immutable types that we don&#39;t want to change ever after instantiating.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Does this make sense?</p>",
