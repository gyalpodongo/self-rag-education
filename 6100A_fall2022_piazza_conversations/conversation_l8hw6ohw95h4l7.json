Given that the test program checks for the number of lines in our output, I am wondering if this could be the reason why it is failing. I'll attach comparison images below. Thank you!  \n  \n![image.png](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fl7uvudf0kfc2sq%2Fc8edfba6db5e80056814f73e6d3d6302ef88ee84d40fad531a3af171a43a81c6%2Fimage.png) ![image.png](/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fl7uvudf0kfc2sq%2Fe2c141f496e9a7936d0cb796da8844f836c545c705996f7ce680c2c629ef5f55%2Fimage.png)</md>",
