In the detailed results, it says that there was an EOF error, which I looked up and appears to be an error related to the input function. Before submitting, I ran the test file and performed independent tests in the console. Moreover, the TA that performed the Checkoff did not find any errors in my code. What could have caused the Autograder to score a 0% and should I be worried?</p>",
