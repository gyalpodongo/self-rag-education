My intuition tells me it shouldn\u2019t be possible, since there are unsolvable problems that can be translated to integer problems whose answers are not known, but at the same time we haven\u2019t really covered this in the course. Could you tell me the abswer to this question just to put my mind at rest? Thank you!",
