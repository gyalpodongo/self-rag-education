        "content": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">Hello, I noticed that for Part C Test 2 for PSET 1, the tester expects my code to take 12 steps to find the lowest usable rate of return. However this seems to be mathematically inaccurate, especially considering that none of the other tests had any &#34;off by one&#34; errors. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the bisection search process for Part C Test 2. A_S is shorthand for amount_saved. &#39;r&#39; is the rate of return.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">-----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>steps = 0<br />A_S (r) = 187,401 * (1 &#43; r/12)^36</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 1) = (1 &#43; 0)/2 = 0.5</p>\n<p>A_S (0.5) = 814718.3809650</p>\n<p>A_S (0.5) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.5</p>\n<p>steps = 1</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 2) = (0.5 &#43; 0)/2 = 0.25</p>\n<p>A_S (0.25) = 393682.617473</p>\n<p>A_S (0.25) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.25</p>\n<p>steps = 2</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 3) = (0.25 &#43; 0)/2 = 0.125</p>\n<p>A_S (0.125) = 272138.47588</p>\n<p>A_S (0.125) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.125</p>\n<p>steps = 3</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 4) = (0.125 &#43; 0)/2 = 0.0625</p>\n<p>A_S (0.0625) = 225938.788117</p>\n<p>A_S (0.0625) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.0625</p>\n<p>steps = 4</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 5) = (0.0625 &#43; 0)/2 = 0.03125</p>\n<p>A_S (0.03125) = 205794.654162</p>\n<p>A_S (0.03125) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.015625</p>\n<p>steps = 5</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>r (loop 6) = (0.03125 &#43; 0)/2 = 0.015625</p>\n<p>A_S (0.015625) = 196388.573571</p>\n<p>A_S (0.015625) &lt; 200,000 -&gt; low_bound_rate = 0.015625</p>\n<p>steps = 6</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 7) = (0.03125 &#43; 0.015625)/2 = 0.0234375</p>\n<p>A_S (0.0234375) = 201038.137867</p>\n<p>A_S (0.0234375) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.0234375</p>\n<p>steps = 7</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 8) = (0.0234375 &#43; 0.015625)/2 = 0.01953125</p>\n<p>A_S (0.01953125) = 198700.133998</p>\n<p>A_S (0.01953125) &lt; 200,000 -&gt; low_bound_rate = 0.01953125</p>\n<p>steps = 8</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 9) = (0.0234375 &#43; 0.01953125)/2 = 0.021484375</p>\n<p>A_S (0.021484375) = 199865.812216</p>\n<p>A_S (0.021484375) &lt; 200,000 -&gt; low_bound_rate = 0.021484375</p>\n<p>steps = 9</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 10) = (0.0234375 &#43; 0.021484375)/2 = 0.0224609375</p>\n<p>A_S (0.0224609375) = 200451.141816</p>\n<p>A_S (0.0224609375) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.0224609375</p>\n<p>steps = 10</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 11) = (0.0224609375 &#43; 0.021484375)/2 = 0.02197265625</p>\n<p>A_S (0.02197265625) = 200158.268997</p>\n<p>A_S (0.02197265625) &gt; 200,000 -&gt; high_bound_rate = 0.02197265625</p>\n<p>steps = 11</p>\n<p><br />r (loop 12) = (0.02197265625 &#43; 0.021484375)/2 = 0.021728515625</p>\n<p>A_S (0.021728515625) = 200011.988638</p>\n<p>&#39;while&#39; loop\u00a0 terminates-- no bisection step</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br />Total # of steps: 11</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Could you please explain this discrepancy?
