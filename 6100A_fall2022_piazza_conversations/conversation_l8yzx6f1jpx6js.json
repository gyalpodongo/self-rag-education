        "content": "<md>Hello! I just took a look at your code, and it seems like that specific test case deals with the following situation: **If the initial deposit amount is greater than or equal to the required down payment minus $100, then the\u00a0best savings rate is 0.0**, not the case where r is supposed to be None.\n\nI noticed a few things in your code. Fixing them results in a correct implementation that passes all test cases.\n\nYou have a check that looks like this: \n~~~\nif (initial_deposit >= ((cost_of_dream_home * portion_down_payment) + 100 or (cost_of_dream_home * portion_down_payment) - 100))\n~~~\nthe first check is doing what you intend for it to do. The second half however, is not being compared to anything. It's truth value just depends on (cost_of_dream_home * portion_down_payment) - 100)) being non-zero. So, you'd want to change it to the following:\n~~~\nif (initial_deposit >= ((cost_of_dream_home * portion_down_payment) + 100 or (initial_deposit >=(cost_of_dream_home * portion_down_payment) - 100)))\n~~~\n\nThe block above would set r to be 0.0, but the way it's currently set up, it would still go into the while loop that follows it, where the value of r gets overridden to be ```None```. To avoid this, you'd want to put the while loop into an ```else``` block, so it doesn't still go in there.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if any part of that needs additional clarification.</md>",
