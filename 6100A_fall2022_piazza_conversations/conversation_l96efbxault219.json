I have contacted them about a replacement and I was told to &#34;sit tight&#34; until a new one is shipped (hopefully before the final). I&#39;ve tried many keyboard shortcuts to boot up the laptop but to no avail. I have pset 4 halfway done, but now I have no access to it, and I do not have access to another personal computer at this time. What can I do? Thank you for any flexibility that can be provided.</p>",
