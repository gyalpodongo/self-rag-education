I also get the error &#34;[PART A] Did you keep all the original comments the file came with? Did you initialize variables at the right places?&#34; for each of the parts when I run the put_in_function. Any help on how to have this work better would be appreciated, as this is keeping me from finishing my PSET.\nBest,\nPablo",

Fixing this should remove the ModuleNotFoundError as well. If you would like to make a private post on Piazza or come to office hours, we can take a look at your code (please don&#39;t post your code in a public post!)</p>",
