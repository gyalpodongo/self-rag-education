If not, that it is not appropriate to take code from that resource and put it in your PSET.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If it DID help you internalize that concept, simply put that concept to action in your own code, and comment which resource you used for future reference. The\u00a0<strong>most important part</strong> of all of this is that you yourself have written that code, and that you understand the code that appears in your pset well enough to walk anyone through it and that you can explain it to an LA / TA during a checkoff.</p>",
