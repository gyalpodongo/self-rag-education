I have highlighted the specific line. <img src=\"https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=attach%2Fl5s90ip6zjd5tz%2Fl7qan195ifk6fo%2Fjskvbrjfjxwq%2Fpublic_2022_10_11.jpg\" /><p></p>I don\u2019t know how I would fix this error because technically there is no more data beyond the bounds of \u201call\u201d graph. The shift maker buttons work fine for other time ranges (1m, 6m, 1y\u2026) and does not generate an error when I reach the limit on if I\u2019m in a different range, but only does during \u201call\u201d.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Should I raise an error to solve this error?\u00a0</div><div>Because although clicking &#43;/- 1M in the \u201call\u201d graph generates an error, it does not affect my usage of the other buttons afterwards at all.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks so much,\u00a0</div><div>Grace\u00a0</div>",
