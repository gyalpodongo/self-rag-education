        "content": "<p>Hi,<br /><br />Just wondering, for the case where the initial deposit is too low and as such the r value will never cause the amount saved to meet the break condition of the while loop, is it ok to say something like:<br /><br />&#34;If you have had more than 20 guesses (i.e. if steps&gt;20), exit the loop and set r=None etc.&#34;?<br /><br />I realise this is an arbitrary value, so I wondered if I should implement another break condition instead. I thought about doing something that compares the difference in successive guesses and if this difference meets a specific tolerance, then exit, but I realised that setting the value of tol/steps at which to break are essentially the same thing.<br /><br />Thanks.</p>",
