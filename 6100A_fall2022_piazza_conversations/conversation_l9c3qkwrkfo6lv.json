Apparently, my code was &#34;killed because it took too long to run&#34;, despite only running for 0.2 seconds over the 4 second allowance (which was not mentioned in the pset guide). My code was not inefficient so I&#39;m not sure why I lost marks for this.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Please let me know if this can be fixed.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Kerb: hcs</div>\n<div>ID# 954106693</div>\n<p></p>",
