I would understand if I missed a few points, but with so little information from the auto grader output, I have no idea what I did wrong. Is there a way to get a manual regrade? Or help with explaining why I failed so many auto grader tests and not tester cases?<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>",

Since the local tester only checked for the closing prices, this was misleading. I think that points should be awarded back for this since the docstrings were inconsistent, and seemingly a lot of students had this issue. Not sure if it&#39;s the exact issue for this student, but a lot of them with very low scores on the autograder probably have some similar issue.eatshirt</p>",
