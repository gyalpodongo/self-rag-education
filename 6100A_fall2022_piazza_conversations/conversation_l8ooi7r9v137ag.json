The logic behind this is that if n%4==0, then n= 4 * (n/4), if n%4 == 1 and n&gt;=9, then n = 4*(n-9)/4 &#43;9 (here, it will work for n&gt;=13 similarly), if n%4==2 and n&gt;=6, then n = 4*(n-6)/4&#43;6 and if n%4==3 and n&gt;=15 then n = 4*(n-15)/4 &#43; 6 &#43; 9. In all other cases, the function returns false, which can be verified by hand since there are only a handful, What is the mistake here? t</p>",
