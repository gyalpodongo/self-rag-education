However, the autograder shows that my code produced the same output as what should be correct. I went to office hours and it seems that the issue is I defined the variable to be &#34;month&#34; instead of &#34;months.&#34; When I run my code in Spyder, I get no errors and get the correct output.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Would it be possible for my grade to be revised?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for your help!</p>\n<p></p>",
